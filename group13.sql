-- Views must be dropped first because they depend on tables.

-- Tables are dropped in reverse dependency order:

-- IF EXISTS prevents errors if the object doesn't exist yet.

-- ============================================================
-- STEP 3: INDEXES
-- Indexes speed up SELECT queries on frequently searched columns.
-- Without an index, SQLite does a full table scan (reads every row).

-- Trade-off: indexes use extra storage and slightly slow down INSERTs/UPDATEs.

-- This ensures updated_at is always accurate without the app needing to set it manually.

-- ============================================================
-- STEP 7: DQL EXAMPLES
-- DQL = Data Query Language (SELECT statements)
-- These 3 example queries demonstrate real use cases of the database.
-- ============================================================

-- DQL EXAMPLES
-- 1. List every route with its platform, fare rule, and frequency.
-- || is the string concatenation operator in SQLite (like + in Python for strings).
-- headway_min || '-' || headway_max || ' min' produces e.g. '4-6 min'
SELECT route_code, route_name, platform, fare_per_stop, headway_min || '-' || headway_max || ' min' AS frequency
FROM Route
ORDER BY route_code;

-- 2. Find all direct routes between two stations and calculate fare.
-- Route_Station is joined TWICE using different aliases (origin, destination).
-- This is called a SELF-JOIN pattern on the same table.
-- ABS() gives the absolute value so direction (Inbound/Outbound) doesn't matter.
-- Fare = number of stops between origin and destination * fare per stop (Rs. 10).
SELECT r.route_code, r.route_name, r.platform,
       ABS(destination.stop_order - origin.stop_order) AS stops,
       ABS(destination.stop_order - origin.stop_order) * r.fare_per_stop AS fare
FROM Route r
JOIN Route_Station origin ON origin.route_id = r.route_id           -- first join: for the starting station
JOIN Station origin_station ON origin_station.station_id = origin.station_id
JOIN Route_Station destination ON destination.route_id = r.route_id  -- second join: for the ending station
JOIN Station destination_station ON destination_station.station_id = destination.station_id
WHERE origin_station.station_name = 'Chamkani'
  AND destination_station.station_name = 'Karkhano Market'
  AND origin.stop_order <> destination.stop_order  -- exclude rows where start = end (same station)
ORDER BY stops;

-- 3. Show live bus occupancy from schedule, bus, and route tables.
-- Joins 3 tables: Bus, Schedule, Route.
-- Calculates occupancy as a percentage: (current_passengers / capacity) * 100.
-- 100.0 (not 100) forces floating point division — integer division would give wrong results.
-- ROUND(..., 0) rounds to zero decimal places (whole number percentage).
-- GROUP BY b.bus_id in app.py version prevents duplicate rows when a bus has multiple schedules.
SELECT b.bus_number, r.route_code, r.route_name, r.platform,
       ROUND((b.current_passengers * 100.0) / b.capacity, 0) AS occupancy_percent
FROM Bus b
JOIN Schedule s ON s.bus_id = b.bus_id      -- link bus to its schedule
JOIN Route r ON r.route_id = s.route_id    -- link schedule to the route
WHERE b.status = 'active';                  -- only show buses that are currently operational
